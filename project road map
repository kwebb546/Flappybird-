To complete my goals regarding flappy bird augmentation I must complete the follwing steps

create a projectile object that will move leftward across the scree, twoard the player
add another key event for when the player needs to "slow down" to avoid projectiles
set up collision detection between projectile and player
add sound effects/soundstrack
cosmetic changes

all of these will be done by me, kurtis webb
